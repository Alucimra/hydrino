# Internal Reference

INTERNAL reference is 1.0~1.2v. Arduino docs say it's 1.1v, but it's not quite right.

The internal reference is based on the bandgap inside the chip.

It's stable for each chip, but across each chip, the number could be slightly different. In other words, two different chips will have different numbers.

You can test it by doing an analogRead with the INTERNAL ref against a known stable voltage, and then figuring out what the reading is (writing to Serial). Could also write to EEPROM, but remember to divide by 4.

internalRefV = maxAnalogRead * voltageGiven / analogReadValue

example:

voltage = 0.8v = 3.2v/4 (divide by 4 via divider)
analogRead = 200

internalRefV = 255 * 0.8 / 200 = 1v

resolution = internalRefV / maxAnalogRead

resolution = 1v/1023 = 0.000977517v per increment

# Math

1.1v / 1023 = 0.001075v

Battery voltage is 2.7-3.6v, but should only be 3.0-3.5 when in use. Divided by ~4 via a pot.

Solar panel is 6v 1W (~0.166mA) (actual, 6.3~6.7 ~130mA), bucked with a mini360 to 3.5v (hopefully giving >250mA).

NAME	current(mA)	analogWrite	baseCurrent

MAXIMUM	200	1023	*
HIGH	100	*	*
MEDIUM	90	*	*
LOW	85	*	*
MIN	80	*	*
OFF	0	0	0

Should be careful about running on LOW and MIN, because if there's a lot of load (high water levels, low air, etc) then it's going to stall the motor.

Because the voltage is varying, we can't quite guarantee the exact current output...

We start the motor off on MAX, and then drop the voltage down to its desired target.

Assuming a gain of ~50 over the range and a 1.1k base resistor:

4.3*(analogOut)/1100 = base current

50*4.3*(analogOut)/1100 = collector-emitter current
