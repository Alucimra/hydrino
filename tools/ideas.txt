# Voltage vs Time graph (Charge remaining)

Needs to convey voltage changes over time.

A Scatter plot is the basic obvious answer. A heatmap is one step up.

Event Drops (Time Series). Size of bars denote how much voltage is left. Maybe also color.

Kagi looks fancy, I think it has a nice correlation with the randomness of stocks.

* Can also reuse event drops to do some of the others, so like a summary of them all in one chart.

# Cycle on/off

A Gant Chart seems like a good fit at first, but the time distribution makes it less useful (1m on to 19m off is too much of a disparity)

# Problems

A lot of these charts are old. Created with d3 version 3, but the current d3 is version 4. So lots of it is kind of broken.

nv.d3 was nice, but seems improperly maintained. The code in the docs is not the stuff being run. Can't get the multiBarChart to work.
