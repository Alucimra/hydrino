# Voltage vs Time graph (Charge remaining)

Needs to convey voltage changes over time.

A Scatter plot is the basic obvious answer. A heatmap is one step up.

Event Drops (Time Series). Size of bars denote how much voltage is left. Maybe also color.

* Can also reuse event drops to do some of the others, so like a summary of them all in one chart.
